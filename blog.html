        <h2>Kernel-level anti-cheats SUCK, and here’s why</h2>
        <p>
          There’s a growing trend in multiplayer games where developers deploy anti-cheat software that runs at the
          kernel level, with deep access to your hardware and operating system. Riot’s Vanguard is a well-known example
          of this kind of anti-cheat, running with the same privileges as the OS itself
          <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          These anti-cheats also tend to conflict with each other. A real-world example was Battlefield 6 refusing to
          run if Riot Vanguard was installed, because both systems competed for low-level control
          <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that, kernel-level anti-cheats introduce real performance and privacy risks. They can observe most
          running processes and system activity, and users have reported overhead, instability, and general system
          issues <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this is done largely to reduce the cost of proper server-side cheat detection. Instead, your PC becomes
          a constantly reporting client tied to their infrastructure. If anything goes wrong on their end, your system
          is the one exposed <sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would strongly advise against buying or supporting games from companies that operate like this. They treat
          you, the user, like a cow to be milked. They give zero shits about your privacy, and every “security” measure
          they add is another attack on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protection SHOULD be done on the server side, never on the client. Trusting the client is the worst thing you
          can do in any web service. Any client-side protection can be inspected, modified, bypassed, or removed
          entirely. Going kernel-level doesn’t make an anti-cheat foolproof — cheaters can and do write their own kernel
          drivers <sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make things worse, some companies push misleading narratives about Linux being a major source of cheating.
          Community discussions around Apex Legends highlight this clearly <sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Apex Legends developers, removing Linux support supposedly reduced cheating by 33%. This is
          honestly hilarious, considering the game experienced a major player drop during the same period. They also
          stated that Linux users made up only about 2% of the player base <sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>That logic simply does not hold up.</p>
        <p>And in the end, this noisy and messy approach still fails to eliminate cheaters.</p>
